# Basic Decentralized Wallet Tracker

## Project Title
Basic Decentralized Wallet Tracker

## Project Description
This project implements a Solidity smart contract that allows users to track multiple Ethereum wallets on the blockchain. The Wallet Tracker enables users to add, remove, and monitor the balances of different Ethereum addresses in one central location. It provides a decentralized way to keep an eye on various wallet addresses that are important to you without requiring access to their private keys.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to simplify portfolio management for cryptocurrency users by providing a secure, decentralized tool that consolidates wallet information. In a world where individuals often maintain multiple cryptocurrency wallets across different platforms and for various purposes, having a single point of reference to track balances and activity becomes essential. This project aims to deliver that capability while maintaining the core principles of blockchain technology: transparency, security, and user autonomy.

## Future Scope
- Integration with DeFi protocols to track tokens in liquidity pools and yield farming positions
- Implementing alert systems for significant balance changes or transactions
- Adding support for multi-chain wallet tracking (beyond Ethereum)
- Creating a notification system for low gas balances
- Developing a front-end interface with visualization tools for portfolio analysis
- Adding historical balance tracking and performance metrics
- Implementing wallet labeling and categorization features
- Supporting ERC-20 token balances in addition to native ETH

## Key Features
- **Wallet Registration**: Add and remove Ethereum addresses to your tracking list
- **Balance Monitoring**: Check the balance of any tracked wallet in real-time
- **Bulk Operations**: Add or remove multiple wallets in a single transaction
- **Ownership Controls**: Only the contract owner can modify the tracked wallets
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for minimal gas consumption during operations
- **Security**: View-only functionality ensures no access to private keys
- **Transparency**: All tracked wallets are visible on the blockchain
- **Customizable Labels**: Assign names or notes to each tracked wallet
